            <p class="p1"> A star is born inside a mixture of dust and gas, this dust and gas forms a huge cloud called a nebula.<br>
             Gravity causes clumps of dense matter inside the nebula to collapse under their own weight. <br>
             As the pocket of dust collapses, gravity pulls the dust closer together, as pressure builds, temperatures rise.
                <br>
             This is called the T-Tauri phase of a protostar.

            <p> Million of Earth years later when the protostar has collected lots of matter and has reached roughly 15-millon degrees centigrade, the core ignites and the star moves from being a protostar into it's next phase, called the "main sequence".

            <p>Most of the stars in our galaxy including our sun, are in their main sequence, in this phase, they convert Hydrogen gas to Helium gas and radiate x-rays.<br>
                <br>
             Some stars shine brighter than others because of how hot they are, white or blue stars are hotter than orange or red stars.<br>
            <br>
             Stars come in different sizes, the smallest are called dwarf stars, and the largest are called supergiants.<br>
                <br>
             Stars spend 90% of their lives in their main sequence phase.
             Our sun is roughly 4.6 billion years old and is predicted to stay in its main sequence phase for billions of years more.

            <h3>Death of a star</h3>

            <br>
            <p> As stars start to die, most of their Hydrogen has turned to Helium which sinks to the core of the star and raises the temperature.
             When this happens the stars outer shell of hot gases expands out and the star turns into a red giant. <br><br>
             The red giant will later shed its outer layer and become small and dense at this stage, the star is called a white dwarf.<br>

                <br>
                White dwarf stars cool for billions of years and some exist as part of a binary star system in which a star may gather excess mass from their companion until their surfaces explode triggering a bright nova.

            <br>
            <p>
                In most observed cases, white dwarfs eventually go dark and at this point, they become known as black dwarfs.
                <br>
             However a massive star may not follow this path; instead during the red giant phase, their outer shell will still expand, though their core will contract and eventually become so dense it collapses, which triggers a supernova.</p>

            <p>Once the energy has mostly gone from the supernova, a small core can be left behind.
             this core, is called a neutron star.</p><br>
